<h1>A report from the course DA377B</h1>

<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
<p>I have used GIT before. I have also used GitHub before. I prefer using git bash over any other interface.
    For markdown I have used HTML before.
    I took a course in "gymnasiet" where we used HTML.
    In that course we created some very simple websites, using only HTML.
    I don't have much experience in the field of websoft development.
    I knew of the holy trifecta of HTML, CSS and JS.
    I have used JS before.
    Using node.js, I built a simple discord bot.
    I have written maybe 10 lines in total of CSS in my life.
    Front-end development has never been a calling for me.
    GitHub pages is a totally new thing for me.
    As such, it has to be the TIL for me for this section.
    GIT Tags is also something I have not used before.</p>
