<h1>A report from the course DA377B</h1>
</header>

<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
<p>I have used GIT before. I have also used GitHub before. I prefer using git bash over any other interface.
    For markdown I have used HTML before.
    I took a course in "gymnasiet" where we used HTML.
    In that course we created some very simple websites, using only HTML.
    I don't have much experience in the field of websoft development.
    I knew of the holy trifecta of HTML, CSS and JS.
    I have used JS before.
    Using node.js, I built a simple discord bot.
    I have written maybe 10 lines in total of CSS in my life.
    Front-end development has never been a calling for me.
    GitHub pages is a totally new thing for me.
    As such, it has to be the TIL for me for this section.
    GIT Tags is also something I have not used before.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S02</h2>
<p>Some of this info is already in S01
    I have used HTML before as described above.
    CSS I have used sparingly in some projects.
    I have used JavaScript as written above.
    I used node.js and a library for discord bots in order to write one.
    I think the image i added in "about" is quite well describing.
    HTML is like the skeleton of the homepage.
    JavaScript is the nerve system, making sure actions are available.
    CSS is the skin and clothing, giving a nice look.
    HTTP is a protocol built upon TCP/IP. With this protocol a webbrowser (client) can fetch data (such as HTML) from a server. Other data that can be fetched are images and CSS styles
    TILs for this part:
    CSS can be used with XML and SVG
    JS is built on ECMAscript
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S03</h2>
<p>The JavaScript I have used before has been node.js. As thus, I have not written js for clientside before.</p>
<p>JavaScript syntax is very similar to Java. However, there are some very important differences.
    The most important is probably typing. Typing is loose in JS but strong in Java.
    This leads to different operators such as === and !== in order to check value AND type.
    Threading is also different between the languages, which can be seen with how node.js works.
</p>
<p>
    For the coding I went through the list top to bottom. This meant I started with the fetch() part.
    Since I was a bit behind with this course due to my vacation I initially only wanted to go for a 3.
    When the Duck was added I realized there was not much work left to get a 4. In the end I ended up doing work for a 5.
    I think the code is nice in general. However, flags.js code looks kinda weird.
</p>
<p>
    TILs for this part:
    CSS transitions.
    fetch.
    Linear gradient.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S04</h2>
<p>As stated above I have worked with node.js before. But it was with a discord bot and not my own server. Discord bots run on discord servers afaik.</p>
<p>Once I got into it it seemed nice. However, wrapping my head around it at first seemed impossible. 
    Also, since I work on 2 computers I had some problems. I had different versions of express at first with gave me problems.</p>
<p>I didn't really have a plan for this assignment. I had a lack of time due to external factors in my life. I just followed the tutorials given. I think they were very informative and easy to follow.
</p>
<p>Due to time constraints as stated above I only went for a 3. This was not difficult and took only a few hours as soon as everything was set up.
    EJS was the most difficult, but that was also not too difficult. I might come back and do 4 and 5 in the future if I have time and motivation.
</p>
<p>TILs: npm, EJS</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S05</h2>
<p>First time seeing PHP it looked weird. But I kinda like it. It would be interesting to use it more, in order to see if I still like it. Since we will use it in the project, I will have the chance to do this.
    The usage of the dollar sign is still going to take some time to get used to, and its a bit awkward to get it on a nordic keyboard.
    We have used JSP before. JSP seems to be a middle ground between PHP and Java. Also there are definitely some similarities between PHP and Java. For example, the ability to use OOP.
    But of course there are differences. The biggest here is how you connect to a database.
    I aimed for grade 3 at first. However, grade 4 was not that much more difficult, so I did that too. Time constraints made me not want to do more. Atleast not for now.
    I am happy with my work and I feel that I have learned quite a bit that will be useful in the project.
    TIL: DB connection stuff. What the $ actually does.
</p>

<h2>S06</h2>
<p>There are a bunch of categories one can divide programming languages. These are mostly based on the main usage(s) of that language.
    OOP has been "the shit" for a while, and as such languages like Java and C# are popular. Java has been popular for the whole century, but has both decreased and increased in popularity at times. Many schools teach it but that might change.
    Something like functional programming might become more popular in the future, and then other languages can take over.
    For example, some people predict that Python (which is older than Java) might become top dog in the short future. This is mainly due to the popularity of ML.
    Languages like C/C++ will always have an application since they are more low-level and gives the programmer more control than other languages.
    Similarily a language like JavaScript, which also gives a lot of freedom, will retain popularity. These are popular with web devs and there are boatloads of frameworks and libraries to use.
    
    Personally I am a fan of Kotlin, partly due to my interest in android development. I also like the syntactic sugar.
    
    Recommendation would depend on the project at hand. For mobile, I would say Kotlin due to ease of usage while still being powerful.
    For web I would say TypeScript in order to avoid the hassle of the loose typing in JS. For desktop, maybe C# but it depends.
    
    TIL: Python has become extremly popular in the last few years, even though other languages can be better for ML. Scala might be the new JVM language of choice.</p>

<h2>S07</h2>
<p>.NET platform is a platform for development from Microsoft. It uses C#, an OOP language similar to Java. .NET can be used for both console applications and web applications.
    Creating a project in .NET gives a complete skeleton to build upon. This skeleton has some "invisible" connections which can raise questions. But when the programmer has some experience in it, it simplifies a lot of things.
    
    .NET seems to be for much larger projects. At least for the web apps. The built in MVC structure can be very useful for those kinds of projects. Also.NET can be "too much" for smaller projects where something like node.js can be more useful.
    
    
    For the exercise I used the example code as a base. Syntactic wise it is similar to Java so I felt quite comfortable. The formatting standard is different, but I let the IDE auto-format.
    Two differences that took some time to get used to were IEnumerable and more than one type of Int.
    
    For the grade I ended up doing up to grade 4. I did not have a goal in mind when starting the assignment. Instead the grade I did was based on time and motivation.
    
    TIL about how easy it was to build a base structure in .NET.</p>

<h2>S08</h2>
<p>Group members: Oskar Forssman, Liridon Smajli, Henrik Vihlborg

    Chosen pages: Blocket (Oskar), Aftonbladet (Liridon), HKR (Henrik)
    
    Data sheet: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cXB8Q30yARvPpxOt7vSUHlE9bKbWzlKaMRxOq">Click!</a>
    
    HKR.se was chosen since it is the university we go to.
    
    HKR.se seems to be much faster than the other two. It uses best practice a clear majority of the time.
    The best improvement according to the tools from google is to preload resources. This would speed up things quite a bit.
    
    
    Aftonbladet was chosen because it is a popular site for news and it was interesting to see how it would hold up in terms of performance when it came to visiting their website.
    
    The site Aftonbladet suffers mainly from two things: using document.write a lot and having pictures with the wrong aspect ratio.
    This leads to the main thread being overused and slowing down the loading of the site.
    
    Blocket was chosen because we like to sell stuff there. Its a site simply with ads both and it was interesting to see how it held up to the others with performance.
    
    The site Blocket suffers from the vast amount of ads that get published all the time. The tools used recommend to update to http2 and fix so the images are in correct aspect ratio.

<h2>S09</h2>
<p>Any time SQL is used, the programmer has to check for and protect against injections. 
    This is done differently in different languages, but should _always_ be done when using SQL! It is usually an easy fix.
    
    Nowadays, many libraries are used, often cross-used with eachother. Sometimes flaws are found a long time after the library has been used, forcing the programmer to update it or not use it.
    This is a more difficult problem to tackle IMO.
    
    User authentication is always a consern when used. Sometimes its just a gate that can easily be bypassed.
    More complex programs usually require more complex authentication. This is (programatically) probably the most difficult of the problems I have mentioned.
    
    A tip to a new (web)programmer is to always apply https. 
    As we have seen in previous courses, http is so unsecure that sending any data that can be sensitive makes it open to anyone to sniff.
    Similarly, use SSH when applicable.
    I would also show them some tools which can be used to analyze the security.
    
    TIL: Shoulder surfing is evil.</p>

<h2>S10</h2>
<p>The project was implemented using PHP, HTML and CSS. We spent a weeking focusing on the project and achieved a good start.
    However, when beginning to implemet REST we ran into some problems. Different solutions were attemped, and it took a few
    days until we achieved a solution which was good enough.
    
    The project was reasonably difficult. Giving the students the choice in how complex or simple the project should be is
    a good idea.
    
    Working in a team went well. We divided the workload in a good way.
    
    The course as a whole was good. There were a lot of technologies learnt. This made it slightly difficult to keep track of,
    but I thought it was a good learning experience. Looking at charts of popularity showed that a lot of technologies are used,
    giving a good reason to learn them. The lecture/excercise setup was good. Studying for the exam is slightly weird. 
    Getting to know more what to study would be nice but let's see how it is on friday. 
    
    I give the course an 8/10.
    
    Final TIL was something we learned after turning in the project: the <pre> css tag which fixed some design bugs we had.</p>
