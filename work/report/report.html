<h1>A report from the course DA377B</h1>
</header>

<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
<p>I have used GIT before. I have also used GitHub before. I prefer using git bash over any other interface.
    For markdown I have used HTML before.
    I took a course in "gymnasiet" where we used HTML.
    In that course we created some very simple websites, using only HTML.
    I don't have much experience in the field of websoft development.
    I knew of the holy trifecta of HTML, CSS and JS.
    I have used JS before.
    Using node.js, I built a simple discord bot.
    I have written maybe 10 lines in total of CSS in my life.
    Front-end development has never been a calling for me.
    GitHub pages is a totally new thing for me.
    As such, it has to be the TIL for me for this section.
    GIT Tags is also something I have not used before.</p>

<section>
<h2>S02</h2>
<p>Some of this info is already in S01
    I have used HTML before as described above.
    CSS I have used sparingly in some projects.
    I have used JavaScript as written above.
    I used node.js and a library for discord bots in order to write one.
    I think the image i added in "about" is quite well describing.
    HTML is like the skeleton of the homepage.
    JavaScript is the nerve system, making sure actions are available.
    CSS is the skin and clothing, giving a nice look.
    HTTP is a protocol built upon TCP/IP. With this protocol a webbrowser (client) can fetch data (such as HTML) from a server. Other data that can be fetched are images and CSS styles
    TILs for this part:
    CSS can be used with XML and SVG
    JS is built on ECMAscript
