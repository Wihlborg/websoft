<h1>A report from the course DA377B</h1>
</header>

<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
<p>I have used GIT before. I have also used GitHub before. I prefer using git bash over any other interface.
    For markdown I have used HTML before.
    I took a course in "gymnasiet" where we used HTML.
    In that course we created some very simple websites, using only HTML.
    I don't have much experience in the field of websoft development.
    I knew of the holy trifecta of HTML, CSS and JS.
    I have used JS before.
    Using node.js, I built a simple discord bot.
    I have written maybe 10 lines in total of CSS in my life.
    Front-end development has never been a calling for me.
    GitHub pages is a totally new thing for me.
    As such, it has to be the TIL for me for this section.
    GIT Tags is also something I have not used before.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S02</h2>
<p>Some of this info is already in S01
    I have used HTML before as described above.
    CSS I have used sparingly in some projects.
    I have used JavaScript as written above.
    I used node.js and a library for discord bots in order to write one.
    I think the image i added in "about" is quite well describing.
    HTML is like the skeleton of the homepage.
    JavaScript is the nerve system, making sure actions are available.
    CSS is the skin and clothing, giving a nice look.
    HTTP is a protocol built upon TCP/IP. With this protocol a webbrowser (client) can fetch data (such as HTML) from a server. Other data that can be fetched are images and CSS styles
    TILs for this part:
    CSS can be used with XML and SVG
    JS is built on ECMAscript
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S03</h2>
<p>The JavaScript I have used before has been node.js. As thus, I have not written js for clientside before.</p>
<p>JavaScript syntax is very similar to Java. However, there are some very important differences.
    The most important is probably typing. Typing is loose in JS but strong in Java.
    This leads to different operators such as === and !== in order to check value AND type.
    Threading is also different between the languages, which can be seen with how node.js works.
</p>
<p>
    For the coding I went through the list top to bottom. This meant I started with the fetch() part.
    Since I was a bit behind with this course due to my vacation I initially only wanted to go for a 3.
    When the Duck was added I realized there was not much work left to get a 4. In the end I ended up doing work for a 5.
    I think the code is nice in general. However, flags.js code looks kinda weird.
</p>
<p>
    TILs for this part:
    CSS transitions.
    fetch.
    Linear gradient.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S04</h2>
<p>As stated above I have worked with node.js before. But it was with a discord bot and not my own server. Discord bots run on discord servers afaik.</p>
<p>Once I got into it it seemed nice. However, wrapping my head around it at first seemed impossible. 
    Also, since I work on 2 computers I had some problems. I had different versions of express at first with gave me problems.</p>
<p>I didn't really have a plan for this assignment. I had a lack of time due to external factors in my life. I just followed the tutorials given. I think they were very informative and easy to follow.
</p>
<p>Due to time constraints as stated above I only went for a 3. This was not difficult and took only a few hours as soon as everything was set up.
    EJS was the most difficult, but that was also not too difficult. I might come back and do 4 and 5 in the future if I have time and motivation.
</p>
<p>TILs: npm, EJS</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S05</h2>
<p>First time seeing PHP it looked weird. But I kinda like it. It would be interesting to use it more, in order to see if I still like it. Since we will use it in the project, I will have the chance to do this.
    The usage of the dollar sign is still going to take some time to get used to, and its a bit awkward to get it on a nordic keyboard.
    We have used JSP before. JSP seems to be a middle ground between PHP and Java. Also there are definitely some similarities between PHP and Java. For example, the ability to use OOP.
    But of course there are differences. The biggest here is how you connect to a database.
    I aimed for grade 3 at first. However, grade 4 was not that much more difficult, so I did that too. Time constraints made me not want to do more. Atleast not for now.
    I am happy with my work and I feel that I have learned quite a bit that will be useful in the project.
    TIL: DB connection stuff. What the $ actually does.
